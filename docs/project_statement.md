# **Practical Assignment: Development of an eCommerce Backend System with Spring Boot**

## **Introduction**

In this project, students will design and implement a robust backend system for an eCommerce platform using Java and the Spring Boot framework. The application will serve as the core infrastructure for managing an online store, incorporating critical features such as inventory management, user role-based access control, and secure authentication and authorization mechanisms. This assignment is designed to deepen students’ understanding of backend development, emphasizing the creation of scalable, secure, and well-documented systems that adhere to industry-standard best practices.

The eCommerce backend will act as the foundation for a hypothetical online retail application, enabling seamless interaction between users (e.g., customers and administrators) and the system’s data. By completing this project, students will gain hands-on experience in building a production-ready API, integrating with a database, and ensuring secure and efficient operations, preparing them for real-world software development challenges.

## **Objectives**

- Design and implement a RESTful API for an eCommerce platform that supports core business operations.
- Apply secure authentication and authorization mechanisms to manage user access based on roles.
- Develop a modular and maintainable codebase using the Spring Boot framework and best practices.
- Perform comprehensive testing to ensure functionality, reliability, and security.
- Provide detailed documentation to facilitate system usage and future maintenance.

---

## **Technical Requirements**

- **Programming Language**: Java, using Spring Boot as the primary framework.
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (recommended for its robust support for Spring Boot development).
- **Database**: A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB), with appropriate configuration for connectivity.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or OAuth2 for secure user authentication and role-based authorization.
- **Testing**: Use testing frameworks such as JUnit and Spring Test for unit and integration tests.
- **Documentation**: Document the API using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI or a comprehensive `README.md` file.

## **Project Details**

### **1. Core Features**

- **Inventory Management**:
    - Create a data model for products (e.g., fields like `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`, `stockQuantity`).
    - Implement functionality to manage inventory, including:
        - Adding new products.
        - Updating product details (e.g., price, stock levels).
        - Retrieving product information (individual or lists).
        - Deleting products.
    - Ensure inventory updates are atomic to prevent inconsistencies (e.g., during concurrent updates).

- **User Roles**:
    - Define at least two user roles: **Administrator** (manages inventory, users, and orders) and **Customer** (browses products, places orders).
    - Implement role-based access control to restrict endpoints (e.g., only administrators can add or delete products).

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Secure the API with JWT or OAuth2 to authenticate users.
    - Implement endpoints for user registration, login, and token generation.
    - Enforce authorization rules to ensure users can only access endpoints permitted by their role.

- **Order Management** (Optional Enhancement):
    - Allow customers to create orders by selecting products and specifying quantities.
    - Update inventory stock levels upon order creation.
    - Provide administrators with endpoints to view and manage orders.

### **2. System Architecture**

- Use the Spring Boot framework to structure the application following the MVC pattern (Model-View-Controller), adapted for a backend API where the “View” consists of JSON responses.
- Organize the codebase into logical layers (e.g., `controller`, `service`, `repository`) to promote modularity and maintainability.
- Implement a clear separation of concerns, ensuring that business logic, data access, and API endpoints are distinctly separated.

### **3. Routes**

- Define RESTful endpoints for the core functionalities, adhering to standard conventions:
    - **Product Management**:
        - `GET /api/products`: Retrieve a list of products.
        - `GET /api/products/{id}`: Retrieve a specific product.
        - `POST /api/products`: Create a new product (admin only).
        - `PUT /api/products/{id}`: Update a product (admin only).
        - `DELETE /api/products/{id}`: Delete a product (admin only).
    - **User Management**:
        - `POST /api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
        - `POST /api/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and return a token.
        - `GET /api/users`: Retrieve user list (admin only).
    - **Order Management** (if implemented):
        - `POST /api/orders`: Create a new order (customer only).
        - `GET /api/orders`: Retrieve order history (admin or customer-specific).
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `201 Created`, `404 Not Found`) and meaningful error messages.

### **4. Testing**

- Write unit tests for service-layer logic (e.g., inventory updates, user role validation).
- Write integration tests for API endpoints, covering:
    - Successful cases (e.g., creating a product as an admin).
    - Error cases (e.g., unauthorized access, invalid input).
- Use tools like JUnit, Spring Test, or Postman for manual testing of endpoints.
- Provide a test report summarizing test coverage and results.

### **5. Documentation**

- Create comprehensive documentation in a `README.md` file or using Swagger/OpenAPI, including:
    - **Overview**: Purpose and scope of the eCommerce backend.
    - **Installation Instructions**: Steps to set up the environment, install dependencies (e.g., `mvn install`), and configure the database.
    - **API Endpoints**: Details for each endpoint, including:
        - URL, HTTP method, required parameters, and example request/response.
        - Example:
          ```
          GET /api/products
          Description: Retrieves a list of all products.
          Response: 200 OK
          [
              {"id": 1, "name": "Smartphone", "price": 599.99, "stockQuantity": 50},
              {"id": 2, "name": "Headphones", "price": 79.99, "stockQuantity": 100}
          ]
          ```
    - **Usage Instructions**: How to authenticate, access endpoints, and interact with the system.
    - **Technologies Used**: List of tools and libraries (e.g., Spring Boot, JWT, PostgreSQL).

## **Additional Considerations**

- **Best Practices**:
    - Write clean, modular, and well-commented code, adhering to Java naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for classes).
    - Use dependency injection and Spring Boot’s built-in features to reduce boilerplate code.
    - Define constants for fixed values (e.g., HTTP status codes, role names).
- **Security**:
    - Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks or invalid data.
    - Implement secure password storage (e.g., using bcrypt).
    - Ensure sensitive endpoints are protected with proper authorization checks.
- **Scalability**:
    - Design the system to handle future enhancements, such as adding payment processing or product categories.
    - Use database indexing to optimize query performance.
- **Debugging**:
    - Leverage IntelliJ IDEA’s debugging tools and logging frameworks (e.g., SLF4J) to troubleshoot issues.
